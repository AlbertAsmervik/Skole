// Write a Java program to calculate the percentage of the correctly answered questions on a studentâ€™s test,
//  given the total number of questions on the test and the number of questions the student got right.
// The total number of questions on the test and the number of questions the student got right should 
// be given to the user to input and later stored in the variables totalQuestions and numRight, 
// respectively. Also, note that the percentage should include the fractional part.

// 10 Poeng
